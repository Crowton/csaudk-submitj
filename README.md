FADS Submit program for BlueJ
=============================

Intended audience: Students of *Grundl√¶ggende Algoritmer og Datastrukturer* (FADS), Aarhus University.

In FADS, you have to solve a number of programming tasks along the way.
The programming tasks should be solved in Java using the [BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org/) programming environment.

To solve a programming task, first find the task either in
[Blackboard](https://blackboard.au.dk/webapps/blackboard/execute/launcher?type=Course&id=_66529_1)
or in the [tasks](tasks) directory of this repository.

Then read the task description, download the skeleton Java file, and start coding!

Once you have compiled and tested your solution and got all local testcases passed,
it is time to upload your solution.

You need to use the username and password for the judge system that your TA has hopefully given to you.
If you have technical problems, contact Mathias Rav <rav@cs.au.dk>.
